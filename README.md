**react-browse-movies** is an application that showcases movies and movie information in a minimalist, clean fashion where movie cards are dynamically created based on fetched data via [The Movie Database (TMDb)'s API](https://www.themoviedb.org/).

I built this application to improve my understanding about React, specifically the use of React Hooks, as well as using Declarative Routing using Reach Router.

A big thank you to The Movie Database (TMDb) for allowing me to use their API for this personal project of mine (this product uses the TMDb API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDb).

This modern web application was initially set up using [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/).

A live demo can be found @ [react-browse-movies](https://react-browse-movies.netlify.com/).

In the project directory, you can run:

These commands will install package dependencies and starts the app in the development mode.

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits and you will also see any lint errors in the console.
